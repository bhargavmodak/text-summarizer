    <p>
    A simple syntactic text summarizer that uses cosine similarity to find the most important sentences in a text.

**Note that it does not rephrase the sentences, but rather extracts the most important ones.** The summarizer uses the `nltk`, `numpy`, and `networkx` libraries to tokenize the text, remove stopwords, and create a graph of the sentences, respectively. The graph is then used to calculate the importance of each sentence based on the cosine similarity between the sentences. The sentences with the highest importance are then extracted and concatenated to form the summary.

| Library                                                   | Use in this Project                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [numpy](https://numpy.org/)                               | Used for numerical operations and calculations.                                                                                              |
| [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)                             | Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopwords removal, and for deducing cosine similarity between sentences. |
| [networkx](https://networkx.org/)                         | Used for creating and manipulating graphs. And for Pagerank scores.                                                                          |
| [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) | Used for creating the GUI.                                                                                                                   |


## ↠ How to Run the Summarizer locally

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhargavmodak/text-summarizer
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional):
```bash
cd text-summarizer
python3 -m venv linux_venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

or

```bash
cd text-summarizer
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You can also use `conda` to create a virtual environment.

#### 3. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the summarizer:
```bash
python text_summarizer.py
```
